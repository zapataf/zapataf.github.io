<h2>Biodiversity Informatics Researcher</h2>

<p>We are seeking a Biodiversity Informatics Researcher (BIR) to develop new scientific software to make specimen-based data (phenotypic, genomic, spatial) easily accessible and ready to use for downstream taxonomic analyses. The BIR will develop a computational workflow to integrate data and analyses via modular pipelines, automatize "data wrangling", generate data-driven interfaces to interact with "big data", and create dynamic/reactive documents native to the Web. This is a great opportunity to work in a small research group that uses computational biology to support research and training in quantitative taxonomy and evolutionary biology.</p>
	<p>The ideal candidate will be comfortable with databases (relational or graph) and experienced in writing efficient code and documentation in at least one commonly used programming language (Python, R, Julia, Ruby, C/C++, etc). The BIR will be familiar with standard practices in scientific computing and software engineering including version control, continuous integration, test-driven development, and a focus on minimum viable products.</p>

	<p>The BIR will be part of a research group in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles. The BIR will work and report to the principal investigator and other team members, participate in the organization and management of data sets, and ensure the integrity of complex data sets.</p>
