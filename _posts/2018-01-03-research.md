Research projects in the lab span a broad range of questions in evolutionary biology. A brief description of the major research topics is presented below.

### Populations, species, speciation, and diversification

Research on this topic focuses on evolutionary dynamics at the population level, the nature of species, the processes driving the formation of new species, and the diversification of species through time. We mainly use comparative approaches to address these questions. We are now starting to incorporate experimental approaches.

### Comparative genomics, evolution of phenotypes, and adaptation

Research on this topic focuses on genome evolution, its relationship to phenotypic evolution, and functional implications. We combine genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and phylogenetic comparative methods to study these questions in non-model plant systems.

### Biodiversity informatics

To conduct most of the research described above, we develop and implement new computational approaches, and are particularly interested in openness and reproducibility of computational workflows using continuous integration.
