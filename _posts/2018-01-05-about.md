We are a group of organismic biologists in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.ucla.edu) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu) broadly interested in the evolution of biodiversity, in particular plant biodiversity.

We are interested in evolutionary questions at shallow and deep time scales, with a special focus on the role of ecological factors in population variation, speciation, and diversification, and the evolution of genomes and phenotypes. To address these topics, we integrate multiple types of data, tools, and approaches, including field observations, natural history, low and high throughput phenotyping, genomics, and computational biology. Most of our work is focused on **flowering plants** from south and central America and the California Floristic Province. In addition, we have worked –and continue collaborating– in projects with other groups of organisms.
